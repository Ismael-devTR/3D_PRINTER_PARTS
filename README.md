# Project: Open Source 3D Printable CNC, 3D Printer, and Laser Cutter

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive collection of 3D printable parts and pieces for building your own CNC machine, 3D printer, and laser cutter. All parts are designed using SolidWorks and STL files are provided for 3D printing. The goal is to offer an open-source solution that allows makers and hobbyists to create high-quality, custom machines using readily available resources.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily customize and interchange parts for different machines.
- **High-Quality Parts:** All parts designed using SolidWorks for precision and reliability.
- **Open Source:** All designs and files are freely available for personal and commercial use.

## Requirements

- A 3D printer capable of printing the provided STL files.
- Basic tools for assembly (screwdrivers, wrenches, etc.).
- Electronics and firmware (specific to CNC, 3D printer, and laser cutter).
